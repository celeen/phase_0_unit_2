# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: person/thing, title, time period, pronoun, thesis
# Output: essay, with correct grammar
# Steps:  
#if subject ends in s, to_have equals have
#if subject does not end in s, to_have equals has
#if gender equals male, pronoun equals he, posessive pronoun equals his, object pronoun equals him
#if gender equals female, pronoun equals she, posessive pronoun equals her, object pronoun equals her
#if gender equals it, and if subject ends in s, pronoun equals them, posessive pronoun equals their, object pronoun equals pronoun.
#if gender equal it else, pronoun equals gender, posessive pronoun equals its, object pronoun equals gender. 

#if subject ends in s, posession is ', if variable ends in not s, posession is 's.
#output string with appropriate variables and changed variables interpolated
